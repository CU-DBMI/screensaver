### Add text

Add text to the visualization by adding a `text` parameter to the URL.
Use `\n` for new lines.

Example:  
[https://cu-dbmi.github.io/screensaver?text=DBMI \n Dept. of Biomedical Informatics](https://cu-dbmi.github.io/screensaver/?text=DBMI%20\n%20Dept.%20of%20Biomedical%20Informatics)

### Other customization

Shapes, colors, and other settings customizable in source code.
Time-consuming calculations are cached indefinitely in `localStorage`, so clear this if making changes code.
